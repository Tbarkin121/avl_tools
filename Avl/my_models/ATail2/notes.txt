 Neutral point  Xnp =   0.084657

 Clb Cnr / Clr Cnb  =   0.010731    (  > 1 if spirally stable )

CG = 0.0774
Cref = 0.80000E-01

staticMargin = 0.1 = (x_NP - x_CG)/c_ref <=> x_CG = x_NP - 0.1 * c_ref
staticMargin = (0.084657 - 0.0774)/0.08 = 0.0907

Close enough... 

x_CG = 0.084657 - 0.1 * 0.08 = 0.07667
